# Components

For creating the model, I used the Create Sketch function form the Create tab, and choose the front side of the orthographic view that Fustion 360 uses. I then used the fit point spline to make the ghost ends, and used the same tool to make the head of the ghost controller.This made it into one body. I extruded it to to form an actual structure, then scaled it to dimensions I believed would work as a controller. I then resued the Create Sketch function, front side again, and chose the Center Diameter Circle to make eye shapes for the ghost controller. I used the extrude tool, and the cut option from it to create holes to mimic eyes. I then added LED from the components provided and put them around the eyes, which should light up whenever the ghost moves indicating the controller is fucntioning. 

I exported as an STL file and is inside the Components folder.

For the Technical Drawing, I made the base technical drawing, with the 4 views. Top, Front, Side, and Isometric view. I made another technical drawing with the purpose of showing the dimensions of the circular eyes.

# Assembly

The same STL file is used, but I have included it inside the Assembly folder.

The Assembly technical drawing just include the controller that was made, and includes the part list.

# TinkerCad

The simulation shows a hypothetical when the controller moves, the led will light up. With how minimal TinkerCad is, I chose to do that with a button instead, and controls by how lightly or strongly you tap your mouse. To do this I had to add a two resistors to the breadboard, and wire the circuits in a way where the voltage will reach minimally to the button. The wiring helps achieves this, by also setting it up from the ends of the breadboard with neagative and positive voltage. When the button is lightly tapped both leds will light up but with a lot of fade, if tapped strongly and held both leds will be lit.

The link, recording and screenshot will be provided in the TinkerCad folder.
