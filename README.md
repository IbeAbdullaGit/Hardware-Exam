# Components

For creating the model, I used the Create Sketch function form the Create tab, and choose the front side of the orthographic view that Fustion 360 uses. I then used the fit point spline to make the ghost ends, and used the same tool to make the head of the ghost controller.This made it into one body. I extruded it to to form an actual structure, then scaled it to dimensions I believed would work as a controller. I then resued the Create Sketch function, front side again, and chose the Center Diameter Circle to make eye shapes for the ghost controller. I used the extrude tool, and the cut option from it to create holes to mimic eyes. I then added LED from the components provided and put them around the eyes, which should light up whenever the ghost moves indicating the controller is fucntioning. 

I exported as an STL file and is inside the Components folder.

For the Technical Drawing, I made the base technical drawing, with the 4 views. Top, Front, Side, and Isometric view. I made another technical drawing with the purpose of showing the dimensions of the circular eyes.

# Assembly

The same STL file is used, but I have included it inside the Assembly folder.

The Assembly technical drawing just include the controller that was made, and includes the part list.

# TinkerCad
